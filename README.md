You are in charge of a special task: Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go berserk, so choose wisely!

Luckily you're equipped with some deep learning now, and you will use it to save the day! Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into dinos.txt. 

To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you and your team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath!
